## Story
> Carl is a Network Engineer in the company Live! He has received an urgent task to deploy as soon as possible an ACL with several statements on hundreds of devices in the network.

Difficulties:  
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: urgent task which is unfortunately time-consuming because of tons of devices to configure 
- :sweat: 3 different types of devices: IOS, IOS-XR and Juniper, Carl is not extremely fluent in each CLI type because he is working mostly only with IOS-XR devices
- :hammer_and_wrench: the ACL is going to be deployed there only for 2 weeks, for the purpose of some changes in the network… and then it has to be again removed from all devices
- :sunny: Carl is going at that time for his PTO and there is no one who has enough networking knowledge to remove this configuration from all devices of different vendors
