## Story
> Carl is a Network Engineer in the company Live! He has received an urgent task to deploy an ACL with several statements on 347 devices.

Difficulties:  
- urgent task = time constraint
- 3 different types of devices: IOS, IOS-XR and Juniper, he is not extremely fluent in each
- tons of devices to put the config into it
- the ACL is going to be deployed there only for 2 weeks, for the purpose of MWs, some changes in the network… and then it has to be again removed from all devices
- Carl is going at that time for his PTO and there is no one who has enough networking knowledge to remove this configuration from all different vendors devices

IT’S A NIGHTMARE!! But it might happen...

#### Is there a solution? NSO!
 In this lab we're going to help Carl with his task using NSO - Network Services Orchestrator.
