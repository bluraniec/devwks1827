## NSO - Network Services Orchestrator

Simplify the management of Access Control Lists (ACLs) across network devices. Update ACLs on multiple devices on demand, ensuring that security policies are applied consistently across the entire infrastructure.
NSO has service models corresponding to the desired security policies, and generates ACLs matching the desired policy. Policies are translated into the exact syntax needed for the specific vendors and devices, delivered to the device using the appropriate NED.

Basics about the architecture: 
- SDN (Northbound/Southbound)
- SERVICE
- NETCONF/RESTCONF/YANG Data Models
- CDB
- FASTMAP
- NEDs
