## NSO - Network Services Orchestrator

> NSO? Not So Obvious? :worried:   
> No worries, in this Chapter you will find out more about Network Services Orchestrator and its architecture!

Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) is industry-leading software for automating services across traditional and virtualized networks. Use NSO to add, change, and delete services without disrupting overall service, and help ensure that services are delivered in real time.  

### Why?  
Accelerate revenue-generating services with automated, self-service, on-demand provisioning that reduces activation times from months to minutes.  
Increase agility and scale with the capability to create, reconfigure, and repurpose services in real time with virtually unlimited horizontal scale.  
Simplify your network operations by automating the end-to-end service lifecycle and reducing manual configuration steps by up to 90 percent.  
Promote open architectures with multi-vendor capabilities to automate advanced device features, easily bundle multiple network services, and help assure them in real time.  
Ensure trusted operations with the industry’s most robust feature set for ensuring trust across the network, other management systems and NSO clients, apps and users.  

#### Device management

Network device turn up, configuration, and capability management is handled by an NSO onboard device manager. This reduces manual efforts to manage network elements and lowers risk of errors. Cisco and third-party physical or virtual devices are managed through the device abstraction layer using NEDs (Network Element Drivers).


#### Service orchestration

NSO orchestrates the lifecycle of network related service: development, deployment, and activation. Create, modify, repair, and delete services on-demand

#### One of the Use Cases  

Simplify the management of Access Control Lists (ACLs) across network devices. Update ACLs on multiple devices on demand, ensuring that security policies are applied consistently across the entire infrastructure.
NSO has service models corresponding to the desired security policies, and generates ACLs matching the desired policy. Policies are translated into the exact syntax needed for the specific vendors and devices, delivered to the device using the appropriate NED.

Cisco® Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) enabled by Tail-f® is a model driven (YANG) platform for automating your network orchestration. It supports multi-vendor networks through a rich variety of Network Element Drivers (NEDs).

NSO supports the process of validating, implementing and abstracting your network config and network services, providing support for the entire transformation into intent based networking.

Basics about the architecture: 
- SDN (Northbound/Southbound)
- SERVICE
- NETCONF/RESTCONF/YANG Data Models
- CDB
- FASTMAP
- NEDs
