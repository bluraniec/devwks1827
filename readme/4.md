## Chapter 2 - SERVICE DESIGN

### 1st step - Analyze ACL configurations:
Let's analyze ACL configuration provided by Carl.

ACL Configuration:

ACL Interface Attachment:
<img align="center" src="/readme/table2.png"></img>

<p align="center"> <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> For the simplicity of this lab, we're assuming that for <b>IOS</b> and <b>IOS-XR</b></br> we only consider <b>GigabitEthernet</b> interfaces! </p>

### 2nd step - Parametrize:
Let's figure out what in that configuration (for this scenario) is **static** and what will be a **variable**. <br> <br>
For **ACL Configurations**, we would like to have it **all static** (always deploying same set of rules).  
For **ACL Interface Attachment**, we would like to have **some variables** as below while deploying an ACL service:

Parameter | IOS  | IOS-XR | Junos
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
interface | `[int]` | `[int]` | `[int]`
direction | `[in/out]` | `[ingress/egress]` | `[input/output]`  

We can see that we have **different direction keywords per vendor** - we are going to unify this in our Service to keep it only as **in/out**. 

### 3rd step - Design:
Based on our analysis and parameterization of the configuration provided by Carl, let's design the command that will create service of this ACL:
```
ACL_SERVICE [name] [device] interface [int] direction [in|out]
```
Remember also about the **name of the Service Instance** as its Unique Identifier and add as well **device**.
Example usage:  
```
ACL_SERVICE test1 IOS0 interface 0/0 direction in
ACL_SERVICE test2 JUN0 interface xe-0/2/0 direction out
```
