## Chapter 1 - SETUP

> Let's start! :clap: :muscle: 

### 1st step - Check the structure:
Run `ls` command inside of your NSO container to check the structure of deployed NSO:
```
root@45a559b161b4:/opt# ls
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_1.png"></img>

Great! We see 2 directories:   
- ncs-4.7.1.1 (installation directory)  
- ncs-run (running directory)  

### 2nd step - Login to NSO:
Let's login to our NSO instance as user admin using `ncs_cli -C -u admin` command:
```
root@45a559b161b4:/opt# ncs_cli -C -u admin
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_2.png"></img>

We're in! You may wonder why we have used `-C` option here...  
It means that we would like to have Cisco style of the NSO CLI, if you prefer to have a Juniper style of CLI - you can use `-J` option here :) For the purpose of this lab - we will be following Cisco style. 

### 3rd step - Show onboarded devices:
Let's now take a look on what devices we have onboarded in our NSO by issuing command `show devices brief`.
```
admin@ncs# show devices brief
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_3.png"></img>

You should see these names, addresses and types. 
In our case we have 2 IOS devices, 2 IOS-XR devices and 2 Juniper devices. 
All of them works on localhost because these are our local Netsim simulations.

### 4th step - Show packages:  
Let's see what are the currently existing packages in our NSO instance:
```
admin@ncs# show packages package package-version
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_4.png"></img>

As of now only NED packages for each vendor type.

### 5th step - Sync configuration from devices to NSO:
NSO is an Orchestrator - so the main point in the Network that has knowledge about all of the configuration existing in the connected network devices. To handle out-of-band changes you can check if a device is in sync and if not - write NSOs view to the device (`devices sync-to`) or read changed device configuration into NSO (`devices sync-from`).  

Let's synchronize our NSO instance with devices existing in the network and retrieve these configs inside NSO: 
```
admin@ncs# devices sync-from
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_5.png"></img>

Done! Really? All devices configs available now in the NSO?

Check it! 
For example, take a look if configuration of device IOS0 is present in NSO:
```
admin@ncs# show running-config devices device IOS0
```
Nice! 
What if someone now change something in the network? 
Is NSO going to notice this and retrieve updated config?

Let's check!  

Exit NSO and go to ncs-run directory:  
```
admin@ncs# exit
root@15035c6d951d:/opt# cd ncs-run
```

Try to change something directly on the device IOS0:
```
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run# ncs-netsim cli-i IOS0
admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on ad720ce13193
IOS0> en
IOS0# conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
IOS0(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
IOS0(config-if)# ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
IOS0(config-if)# end
IOS0# exit
```

Get back to NSO and check if configs are synchronized (in-sync):
```
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run# ncs_cli -C -u admin
admin@ncs# devices check-sync
```
<img align="center" width=94% src="/readme/cli_6.png"></img>

Ooops! Nope! We're out of synchronization (out-of-sync) due to config change on IOS0 device!

You can print the changes by issuing:  
```
admin@ncs# devices device IOS0 compare-config
```

Let's sync again to update config in the NSO with that change:
```
admin@ncs# devices sync-from
```
<img align="center" width=80% src="/readme/cli_7.png"></img>

Success! Is that config change really updated in the NSO?
```
admin@ncs# show running-config devices device IOS0
```
Correct!

**Remark:** You can do as well `devices sync-to` in case if you're out-of-sync and someone has made configuration that is not desired to be there. NSO will then update this device with the configuration which is mantained there.
