## Chapter 3.4 - SERVICE CREATION (PYTHON LOGIC)
> Time to work on our ACL_SERVICE skeleton! 💥 <br>
> Third (optional) - Python logic! :construction_worker:

Third part is a Python code of the Service - this is giving an opportunity to provide logic to our Service if we need to calculate something before appending to the template or provide some data from 3rd party to configure it.

In our simple Service example we will not use the Python logic, however let's get familiarize with a possible example. 

Let's assume we would like to have a remark in ACL_CLUS for IOS-XR devices that will be like:  
`Deployed at: [timestamp]` - for example `Deployed at: 1559639735.6099684`.  

### 1st step - Generate additional config
As it is coming from the IOS-XR configuration if you create some static remark for our ACL:
```
devices device IOS_XR0 config cisco-ios-xr:ipv4 access-list ACL_CLUS
30 remark Cisco Live US Restrictions
```

And generate config by `commit dry-run outformat XML`, you will get something like that:

We would like to have instead of static `remark Cisco Live US Restrictions`, Variable - `Deployed at: [timestamp]`.  
Like in the previous Chapter but with the timestamp calculation logic done in the Python.

### 2nd step - Review default ACL_SERVICE/main.py script
Let's take a look on basic structure of the Python script for the Service creation:
```python
class ServiceCallbacks(Service):

    # The create() callback is invoked inside NCS FASTMAP and
    # must always exist.
    @Service.create
    def cb_create(self, tctx, root, service, proplist):
        self.log.info('Service create(service=', service._path, ')')

        vars = ncs.template.Variables()
        vars.add('DUMMY', '127.0.0.1')
        template = ncs.template.Template(service)
        template.apply('ACL_SERVICE-template', vars)
```
Here you can make calculations and then bind result with the template variable.
In the same way like example **DUMMY** variable is binded with the Loopback address - `vars.add('DUMMY', '127.0.0.1')`.

### 3rd step - Add Python logic 
To get the timestamp, we will use built-in python `time` module. To generate timestamp - call it `time.time()`. 
Then only thing to do is to create a variable (let's say **XR_REMARK**) and bind it with the value of result of (**time.time()**).
```python
import time 

class ServiceCallbacks(Service):

    # The create() callback is invoked inside NCS FASTMAP and
    # must always exist.
    @Service.create
    def cb_create(self, tctx, root, service, proplist):
        self.log.info('Service create(service=', service._path, ')')

        vars = ncs.template.Variables()
        vars.add('XR_REMARK', 'Deployed at:' + str(time.time()))
        template = ncs.template.Template(service)
        template.apply('ACL_SERVICE-template', vars)
```
As we concatenate string `Deployed at:` with number `time.time()` - we convert number to string using Python str() function.

### 4th step - Bind result with XML Template
Last step is to call that variable in the XML Template.  
As you remember - Variables from **YANG** were passed by reffering to the structure with slashes -> **{/path/to/value}**  
Variables from **Python** are passed by reffering to it directly with the dollar sign -> **{$XR_REMARK}**

That's it! Each time you will be calling the Service creation, Python is going to calculate remark value and bind it with the template.
