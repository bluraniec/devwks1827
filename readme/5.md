## Chapter 3.1 - SERVICE CREATION (SERVICE SKELETON)
> Designed! Congratz! :boom:  
> Time to make it real! <br>
> Let's first generate a skeleton of our ACL_SERVICE and take a look on its structure! :construction_worker:
  

### 1st step - Navigate to the packages folder
Make sure you're outside of NSO CLI and inside `/opt/ncs-run` directory in the Docker container.
Navigate then to the `packages` folder:
```
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run# cd packages/
```
That's the place for all packages - both NEDs as well as Service packages.

### 2nd step - Generate a skeleton of our ACL_SERVICE
Inside `/opt/ncs-run/packages` issue a command to generate a skeleton of our ACL_SERVICE:
```
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run/packages# ncs-make-package --service-skeleton python-and-template ACL_SERVICE
```
Created! 

### 3rd step - Explore Service structure
Go inside of our package and check what's there:
```
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run/packages# cd ACL_SERVICE
root@ad720ce13193:/opt/ncs-run/packages/ACL_SERVICE# ls
README  package-meta-data.xml  python  src  templates  test
```
By default generated package structure looks following:
<img src="/readme/fulltopo.png"></img>

In Service development - we're taking care of 3 parts of the package:  
- <b>XML TEMPLATE</b> - /template/ACL_SERVICE-template.xml  
- <b>YANG DATA MODEL</b> - /src/yang/ACL_SERVICE.yang    
- <b>PYTHON LOGIC</b> (optional) - /python/ACL_SERVICE/main.py  

Open these 3 files to edit - for example, in Visual Studio Code.
